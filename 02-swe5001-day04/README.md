Thanks for sharing the full flow, Sree. Your lecturer‚Äôs instructions are solid, but they‚Äôre Mac-centric and assume a few things that we‚Äôll need to adapt for your WSL2 + Ubuntu setup. Let‚Äôs walk through the corrected and optimized version of this setup for your environment, step by step.

# üß± Full Argo CD Setup + Spring Boot Deployment (WSL2 Ubuntu + Minikube)

## 1. Install kubectl
You‚Äôve already got this:
```bash
kubectl version --client
```

## 2. Install Minikube
Already done and running:
```bash
minikube start --driver=docker
```

## 3. Create Argo CD Namespace
```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd
```

## 4. Install Argo CD
‚ö†Ô∏è Your lecturer had a typo: argoco instead of argocd. Use:
```bash
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```
Deploys Argo CD‚Äôs full stack into the argocd namespace.

Applies a large YAML manifest that defines:
    1. Deployments
    2. Services
    3. ConfigMaps
    4. Secrets
    5. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
    6. RBAC rules

Check pods:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n argocd
```

## 5. Change Argo CD Service Type to NodePort
You‚Äôre making the Argo CD web interface accessible from your browser. By default, Kubernetes services are internal-only. So we need to change the service type and get the external access URL.

This exposes the Argo CD UI via a stable port:
```bash
kubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd \
    -p '{"spec": {"type": "NodePort"}}'
```

What This Does:
    ‚Ä¢ Changes the service type from ClusterIP (internal-only) to NodePort (externally accessible via Minikube).
    ‚Ä¢ Assigns a port (usually between 30000‚Äì32767) that you can use to reach the UI.

Get Access URL:
```bash
minikube service argocd-server -n argocd --url
```
This command:
    ‚Ä¢ Finds the external IP and port for the argocd-server service.
    ‚Ä¢ Returns a URL like:
        http://127.0.0.1:32768

## 6. Check Argo CD Resources
```bash
kubectl get all -n argocd
```

## 7. Get Argo CD Admin Password
```bash
kubectl get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -n argocd \
    -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode
```
Username: admin
Password: <your-password-here>

## 8. Get Argo CD UI URL
```bash
minikube service argocd-server -n argocd --url
```
Open the URL in your browser. You‚Äôre in!

# Deploy the Spring Boot App

## 9. Build and Push Docker Image
Make sure your Docker is running inside Ubuntu and logged in to Docker Hub:
```bash
docker build -t <your-dockerhub-username>/<app-name>:v1 .
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/<app-name>:v1
```
If you have a build.sh, rename it to build.cmd for Windows, but since you‚Äôre in Ubuntu, you can run it directly:
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

## 10. Apply Argo CD Application Manifest
This tells Argo CD to deploy your app:
```bash
kubectl apply -f application.yaml
```
Make sure application.yaml includes:
    ‚Ä¢ Git repo URL
    ‚Ä¢ Path to manifests
    ‚Ä¢ Target namespace (e.g. cicd-demo-app)
    ‚Ä¢ Sync policy

## 11. Check App Status
```bash
kubectl get svc -n cicd-demo-app
```

## 12. Expose App Port
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/cicd-demo-app -n cicd-demo-app 8080
```
Now visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to test your app.

# üß† Bonus Tips
    ‚Ä¢ You can use `argocd app list` and `argocd app get <app-name>` if you install the Argo CD CLI.
    ‚Ä¢ Argo CD will auto-sync your app if you enable automated sync policy.
    ‚Ä¢ You can deploy multiple apps across namespaces‚Äîjust change `destination.namespace` in the manifest.
